## 📚 Course Overview

This project repository consists of **16 structured experiments** completed as part of a comprehensive **Skill Development Course** focused on full-stack web development. The curriculum emphasized both the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and **Django** (Python-based web framework). Through these experiments, we gained hands-on experience in:

- 🔹 Frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- 🔹 Backend logic with PHP, Node.js, Express, Java, and Django
- 🔹 Database integration using MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite
- 🔹 Full-stack web application architecture
- 🔹 Authentication, API routing, XML validation, and more

Each experiment was designed to reinforce practical skills and simulate real-world development workflows.
